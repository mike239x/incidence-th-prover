# Incidence theorem prover

Part of my bachelor.

Given a configuration of lines and dots + 3 selected dots generates a proof that given
3 points are lying on the same line.

The concept is not working for all
possible incidence theorems, but for quite a variety of them. Uses
biquadratic polynomials generated by Grassman-Plucker equations coming from 3 points lying on a single line. I'll add better explanation later.

Some side notes:
 - Cindy has built-in function for returning incidences of an object, but it guesses those.
 f.e. for the Pappos Theorem
 `cindy.evokeCS('print(incidences(I))')` prints `[g,h,i]` instead of only `[h,i]`.
