# Incidence theorem prover

Part of my bachelor.

Given a set of lines and dots + 3 selected dots generates a proof that given
3 points are lying on the same line. The concept is not working for all
possible incidence theorems, but for quite a variety of them. Uses
biquadratic polynomials generated by Grassman-Plucker equations coming from
3 points lying on a single line.
